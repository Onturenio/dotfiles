dotfiles
========

My setup files to share among different computers.

Currently only setups for Git, Vim, Bash and Top.

Files in this repository are named without dot. The installation consists of creating links from the original files to the dotted files in the HOME directory. When changes are made in the setup, the dotfiles repository is updated, and the commit can be done to send the "current" setup to the Github directory.

The INSTALL.sh file is a simple script to create the proper links.
